# Defato team

# Images are located in /source/images/team and are displayed as 100x100px.
# It will look for #{firstname.downcase}.jpg, so for Matthijs it will check if matthijs.jpg exists.
# If you need another filename add i.e: image: madeyes.jpg
# If no image is found or set a placeholder will be used.
